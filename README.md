# SnapChatLikeScroll

This project is an example of a simple way to set up 3 screen size views next to each other, lined up horizontally. The user can then scroll between them by swiping but whenever the user removes their finger, the app will slide the most in sigh view over so it fills up the whole screen, just like SnapChat.
